\section*{Problem 2}

Let $Y = U \Sigma V^T$ be the SVD of $Y$. In PCA we want to do either of the following:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Center the \textit{columns} in $Y$ when the latent matrix $W$ is chosen as the $k$ first columns of $U$
  \item Center the \textit{rows} in $Y$ when the latent matrix $W$ is chosen as the $k$ first columns in $V$
\end{enumerate}

Thus if we would want to do PCA on both the columns and rows of $Y$ using the \textit{same} SVD it would require us to center both the rows and columns of $Y$ at the same time which is \textit{not possible} in general. Thus is it not possible to perform PCA on both rows and columns of $Y$ using the same SVD.
