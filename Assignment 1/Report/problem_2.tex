\section*{Problem 2}

Given that we want to do PCA using $k$ components on a matrix $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times n}, \; p \leq n$ where the columns correspond to data points, we can decompose $Y$ in the following manner using SVD.

\begin{equation}
  Y = U \Sigma V^T
\end{equation}

Where $U$ contains the left singular vectors of $Y$ and $V$ contains the right singular vectors of $Y$.

The transformation matrix $W$ is then given by the first $k$ columns of the matrix $U$.

If we instead want to perform PCA using $k$ components on $Y^T$ we can use that

$Y^T = (U \Sigma V^T)^T = V \Sigma U^T$

The transformation matrix $\widetilde{W}$ can thus be chosen as the first $k$ columns in $V$.


Thus is a single SVD computation sufficient for computing PCA on both columns and rows.
