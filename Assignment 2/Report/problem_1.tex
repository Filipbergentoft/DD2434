\section*{2.1 Dependencies in a Directed Graphical Model}

\subsection*{Question 2.1.1:}
\textit{In the graphical model of Figure \ref{figure1}, is $\mu_{r,c} \perp \mu_{r,c+1}$?}
\\

\textbf{Answer:} No, $\mu_{r,c}$ and $\mu_{r,c+1}$ are dependent.

\subsection*{Question 2.1.2:}
\textit{In the graphical model of Figure \ref{figure1}, is $X_{r,c} \perp X_{r,c+1} \| \{mu_{r,c}, \mu_{r,c+1} \}$?}
\\

\textbf{Answer:} Yes, $X_{r,c}$ and $X_{r,c+1}$ are d-separated and thus independent.
