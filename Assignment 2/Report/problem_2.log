l.46 ...hus need to compute equation (\ref{sol_eq}
                                                  ) using dynamic programming.
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.


LaTeX Warning: Reference `sol_eq' on page  undefined on input line 46.
